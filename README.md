# Open Source

ðŸ’™ Open Source Software from Antribute

## Prerequisites

In order to start using this monorepo, you're gonna need to install a few things:

- [Bun ^1.0.6](https://bun.sh/)

Additionally, the following things are nice to have, and have built-in support in this repo:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and CD into it
1. Run `nvm use` from the repo root. This ensures you're using the correct node version
1. Run `bun add` to install all dependencies. This might take awhile on your first run

- `bun run dev:ui` - Runs storybook for the Antribute UI
- `bun run lint` - Runs ESLint on all apps, packages, and servers
- `bun run lint:fix` - Runs ESLint on all apps, packages, and servers, adds `--fix` to auto-fix any issues
- `bun run postinstall` - Runs after `bun add`, auto installs precommit hooks
- `bun run style:format` - Runs Prettier format on all files (except those `.prettierignore`)
- `bun run style:lint` - Runs Prettier check on all files (except those `.prettierignore`)
