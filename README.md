# Open Source

ðŸ’™ Open Source Software from Antribute

## Prerequisites

In order to start using this monorepo, you're gonna need to install a few things:

- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Installed by running `nvm use` in the root of the repo)
- [PNPM 8.x](https://pnpm.io/)

Additionally, the following things are nice to have, and have built-in support in this repo:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and CD into it
1. Run `nvm use` from the repo root. This ensures you're using the correct node version
1. Run `pnpm i` to install all dependencies. This might take awhile on your first run

- `pnpm run build:servers` - Creates production builds of all servers
- `pnpm run clean` - Deletes all node modules and builds, re-installs dependencies
- `pnpm run dev:ui` - Runs storybook for the Antribute UI
- `pnpm run lint` - Runs ESLint on all apps, packages, and servers
- `pnpm run lint:fix` - Runs ESLint on all apps, packages, and servers, adds `--fix` to auto-fix any issues
- `pnpm run postinstall` - Runs after `pnpm i`, auto installs precommit hooks
- `pnpm run style:format` - Runs Prettier format on all files (except those `.prettierignore`)
- `pnpm run style:lint` - Runs Prettier check on all files (except those `.prettierignore`)
