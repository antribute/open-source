# Open Source

ðŸ’™ Open Source Software from Antribute

## Prerequisites

In order to start using this monorepo, you're gonna need to install a few things:

- [Bun ^1.0.6](https://bun.sh/)

Additionally, the following things are nice to have, and have built-in support in this repo:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and CD into it
1. Ensure bun is running on the latest version by running `bun upgrade`
1. Run `bun add` to install all dependencies. This might take awhile on your first run
